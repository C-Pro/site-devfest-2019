## Description

In this talk, we will start from a famous and affordable microcontroller unit.
We will first discover how to write code for this MCU so we can get environment data. Then we will connect the microcontroller to the Cloud using Google Cloud IoT Core.
Our goal is to discover what these online Cloud IoT solutions offer, and why you may (or may not) need those.

We will focus on Google Cloud IoT core, core concepts remaining the same on other online platforms.
