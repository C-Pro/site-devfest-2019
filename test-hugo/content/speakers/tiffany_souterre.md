I love science and I love data! After finishing a Ph.D. in genetic engineering, I continued my quest for discovering new patterns through data science and machine learning. I currently work as a Big Data engineer and I play with machine learning algorithms on my free time. Someday, I wish to leverage data exploration to improve people's life.
